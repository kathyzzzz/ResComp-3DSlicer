# Welcome!

Welcome to the Research Computing Services 3D Slicer repository. Here you will find some online learning resources which are intended to complement and supplement our in-person workshops. 

## 1. Getting started

3D Slicer is a free and open source software package for medical image analysis and scientific visualisation. You can download 3D Slicer at https://www.slicer.org/ A mouse is optional, but recommended.

## 2. ResPitch

This is a short presentation aimed at "pitching" the program. You'll learn what 3D Slicer is, how it can be used, and complete some fun mini-challenges which introduce you to the basics of the program. Some notes have been added to the PowerPoint to help you work through the slides at your own pace, in the comfort of your own home. They should take approximately 30 minutes. 

Download the slides and cheat sheet to get started.

## 3. Workshops

This presentation is usually delivered as part of our two-hour long workshops. It is intended to walk you through an expanded version of the basics of the program, with challenges to test your learning along the way. These slides go through what medical image data sets are, volume rendering, segmenting techniques, and an overview of 3D printing. **NB:** Although some of the images are slightly out of date, much of the information remains the same.

Download the slides to get started.

## 4. Further resources

This [GitBook](https://lassoan.gitbooks.io/test-book/content/) is a great instructional manual for getting started with 3D Slicer, and complements the workshop.

The [3D Slicer wiki](https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Main_Page) is full of interesting information, especially about particular 

The [3D Slicer discussion forum](https://discourse.slicer.org/) is a place you can ask questions and meet other people using 3D Slicer as well.
