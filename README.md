# Welcome!

Welcome to the Research Computing Services 3D Slicer repository. 3D Slicer is a free and open source software package for medical image analysis and scientific visualisation. Here you will find online learning resources which are intended to complement our in-person workshops. 

## 1. Getting started

All you'll need is your laptop. A mouse is optional, but recommended. You can download 3D Slicer at https://www.slicer.org/ The program comes with in-built sample data sets, which are great to practice on. You may also find some free, open-source data sets on the Internet if you look in the right places. However, when embarking on your own projects, please be aware of the strict rules around patient privacy. Confidentiality is paramount, and data should not be shared or taken without explicit consent or authorisation.

## 2. ResPitch

This is a short presentation aimed at "pitching" the program. You'll learn what 3D Slicer is, how it can be used, and complete some fun mini-challenges which introduce you to the basics of the program. Some notes have been added to the slides to help you work through them at your own pace. This should take approximately 30 minutes. 

Download the slides, cheat sheet and checklist to get started.

## 3. Workshops

This presentation is usually delivered as part of our two-hour long workshops. It is intended to walk you through an expanded version of the basics of the program, with challenges to test your learning along the way. These slides go through what medical image data sets are, volume rendering, segmenting techniques, and an overview of 3D printing. **Note:** Although some of the images are slightly out of date, much of the information remains the same.

## 4. Further resources

This [GitBook](https://lassoan.gitbooks.io/test-book/content/) is a great instructional manual for getting started with 3D Slicer, and complements the workshop.

The [3D Slicer wiki](https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Main_Page) is full of interesting information, especially about particular 

The [3D Slicer discussion forum](https://discourse.slicer.org/) is a place you can ask questions and meet other people using 3D Slicer as well.
